xml.etree.ElementTree (ET in short)


The Element type is a flexible container object, designed to store hierarchial data structures in memory. The type can be described as a cross between a list and a dictionary.

Each element has a number of properties associated with it:

1. A tag which is a string identifying what kind of data this element represents (the element type, in other words).

2. A number of attributes, stored in a python dictionary.

3. A text string.

4. An optional tail string.

5. A number of child elements, stored in a Python sequence.

To create an element instance, use the Element constructor or the Subelement() factory function.


The ElementTree class can be used to wrap an element structure, and convert it from and to XML.

XML is an inherently heirarchial data format, and the most natural way to represent it is with a tree. ET has two classes for this purpose - ElementTree represnts the whole XML document as a tree, and Element represents a single node in this tree. Interaction with the whole document (reading and writing to/from files) are usually done on the ElementTree level. Interactions with a single XML element and its sub-elements are done on the Element level.
