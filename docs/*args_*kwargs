The syntax *args in function is used to pass
a variable number of arguments in a function.

The *args allows us to do is take in more arguments than the number of formal arguments that previously defined.
With *args any number of extra arguments can be tracked on to our current formal parameters.

For example : we want to make a multiply function that takes any number of arguments,
and able to multiply them all together. 
It can be done using *args.

Using the *, the variable we associate with * can become iterable.
Which implies we can use iterate over them, can run some higher order
functions such as map and filter.
