Logging enables the developers to understand what code is actually doing and how the work-flow is. A large part of software developers' lives is monitoring, troubleshooting and debugging. Logging makes this a much easier and smoother process.

Visualisation of specific logged data has following benefits:

1. Monitor the operations of the system remotely.
2. Communicate information clearly and efficiently via stastical graphics, plots and information graphics.
3. Extract knowledge from the data visualized in the form of different graphs.
4. Take necessary actions to better the system.

There are number of ways we can visualize raw data. There are a number of libraries in the python language that can help in plotting graphs.
