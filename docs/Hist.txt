The core purpose to a histogram is to understand the distibution of a given dataset.

A histogram represents the number of occurrences on the y-axis of different values of a variable, found on the x-axis.

The Central limit theorm states the distribution of sample means should be approimately normal.

The key takeaway here is that even if the input variables are not normally distributed, the sampling distribution will approximate the standard normal distribution.
