Loss functions helps in optimizing the parameters of the neural networks. The objective is to minimize the loss for a nerual network by optimizing its parameters(weights). The loss is calculated using loss function by matching the target(actual) value and predicted value by a neural network. Then we use the gradient descent method to update the weights of the neural network such that the loss is minimized.
