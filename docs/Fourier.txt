The Fourier transform is a way of splitting something up into a bunch of sine waves.

The Fourier Transform is a technique that transforms a signal into its constituent components and frequencies.

Fourier transform is widely used not only in signal (radio, acoustic etc) processing but also in image analysis eg edge detection, image filering, image reconstruction, and image compression. 
eg. Fourier transform of transmission electron microscopy images helps to check the periodicity of the samples.
Periodicity - means pattern. Fourier transform of your data can expand accessible information about the analyzed sample.

Given the sum of the two signals, can we recover the original signals.

That's what a Fourier transform does. It takes up a signal and decomposes it to the frequencies that made it up.
