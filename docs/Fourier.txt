The Fourier transform is a way of splitting something up into a bunch of sine waves.

The Fourier Transform is a technique that transforms a signal into its constituent components and frequencies.

Fourier transform is widely used not only in signal (radio, acoustic etc) processing but also in image analysis eg edge detection, image filering, image reconstruction, and image compression. 
eg. Fourier transform of transmission electron microscopy images helps to check the periodicity of the samples.
Periodicity - means pattern. Fourier transform of your data can expand accessible information about the analyzed sample.

Given the sum of the two signals, can we recover the original signals.

That's what a Fourier transform does. It takes up a signal and decomposes it to the frequencies that made it up.


Fourier transform does is It kind of moves us from the time domain to the frequency domain.

Inverse frequency transform (IFT) helps us to go back from the frequency domain to the time domain.

Any continuous signal in the time domain can be represented uniquely and unambigiously by an infinite series of sinusoids.

The continuous Fourier transform converts a time-domain signal of infinite duration into a continuous spectrum composed of an infinite number of sinusoids. We deal with signals that are discretely sampled, usually classical Fourier transform algorithm can be expressed as a Discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time Fourier transform.
